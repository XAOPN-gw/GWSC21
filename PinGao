% Generates a Frequency modulated (FM) sinusoid signal S. X is the vector of
% time stamps at which the samples of the signal are to be computed. SNR is
% the matched filtering signal-to-noise ratio of S. F0 is the frequency
% of the carrier sinusoid and (B, F1) is the (amplitude, frequency) of the
% modulator sinusoid.
